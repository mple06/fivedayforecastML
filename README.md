# Weather Dashboard

I built a weather dashboard application with a search feature to find current weather condtions and 5-day forecast for numerous cities.
  - Displays the information below
    - City
    - Date
    - Weather Icon
    - Temperature
    - Wind Speed
    - Humidity
    - UV Index and colored coded 
      - green (0-5, good condition)
      - yellow (6-9, moderate condition)
      - red (10 or higher, bad condition)

  - 5-day forecast displays
    - Date
    - Weather Icon
    - Temperature
    - Humidity

This application was built using HTML, CSS, and JQuery. This app used 3 API's below from OpenWeather (https://openweathermap.org/api). Layout powered by Bootstrap and current date is powered by moment.JS.
  - Current Weather Data
  - 5 Day Forecast
  - One Call
